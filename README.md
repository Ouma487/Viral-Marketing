## Description

The operation, entitled Orizon,created by GreenPeace, features a fake real estate agency that practices “predictive real estate”. The fictitious start-up Orizon proposes to simulate the rising waters caused by global warming to determine the real estate that will be located on the coast in the years to come.Through this campaign, Greenpeace challenges users, denouncing economic cynicism . It aims to make people realize that climate change is a reality whose consequences will be measurable and will impact everyone's existence.
Our main goal is to propose a strategy that helps viewing the video by the maximum number of people,and thus,raizing the awarnesse of the public regarding global warming.
The KPI we have chosen is the number of likes. Indeed, this indicator makes it possible to measure the number of people who have been sensitive to the video. It is a form of light subscription to the campaign which guarantees us that the user has viewed the content (unlike a view on instagram where it is enough to have viewed the content only 3s). Finally, the number of reposts could have been considered, but a repost will itself generate a certain number of likes from a new audience which will in turn be affected by the marketing campaign. In practice we have made the assumption that when a user reposts a post then he likes it. Our real KPI is therefore Number of Reposts + Number of Likes.
We then measure the spread of information via reposts and the impact of the campaign with the number of likes.
